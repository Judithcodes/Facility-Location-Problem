## Capacitated Facility Location Problem

---

### Intro

I try to solve this problem with two different algorithm:

+ Greedy Algorithm
+ Simulated Annealing Algorithm

---

### File Structure

```
.
|- greedy
|- Instances
|- SA
```

`/Instances` stores the test data. `/greedy` stores the result using greedy algorithm. `SA` stores the result using SA algorithm.

---

### How to Run?

open console:

```bash
$ g++ FLP.cpp main.cpp -o test
```

Run a single test:

```bash
$ test < in.txt > out.txt
```

Run batch test (Please make sure you look up the bat file first to store the result in the right file):

```bash
$ test.bat
```
